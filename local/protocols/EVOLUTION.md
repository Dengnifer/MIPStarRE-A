# Protocol evolution ledger

Dated amendments to the protocols in this directory (and to `AGENTS.md`).
Every entry cites its trigger per `meta.md`. Newest last.

## 2026-08-30 — Founding: localization of the parent GitHub workflow

**Trigger:** project start (user directive): continue the self-evolved
workflow of LionSR/MIPStarRE with all GitHub operations replaced by local
ones; record telemetry for a research paper.

**Change:** created `local/` (DESIGN.md, protocols/, personas/, bin/),
`issues/`, `prs/`, `results/telemetry/`. `.github/` frozen as reference.
Initial protocols derived from a 7-reader study of the parent snapshot
(507e81220); the parent's post-mortem comments were ported as invariants
(single cache writer, review-after-green-CI, fix serialization + combined
iteration cap, trusted prompts, untrusted-data framing, bracket-free naming).

**Expected effect:** parity with the parent workflow's guard set from day one,
minus GitHub event plumbing, which becomes explicit script invocation.

## 2026-08-30 — Worktree bootstrap resets vendored packages

**Trigger:** events.md 2026-08-30 "Dirty vendored package blocks
`lake exe cache get`" (first build attempt failed).

**Change:** `worktree-setup.sh` resets dirty vendored package git trees
before `lake exe cache get`; the ProofWidgets fresh-state workaround from
docgen.yml:56-64 is kept alongside it.

**Expected effect:** cache fetch never aborts on inherited package dirt.

## 2026-08-30 — Fan-in data passed by path, not inline

**Trigger:** events.md 2026-08-30 "Workflow critic stalled on oversized
prompt" (study-fleet critic failure).

**Change:** orchestration rule in `sessions.md` scope: synthesis/critic
agents receive large upstream results as file paths to read, with inline
context capped; adopted for all future fan-in stages.

**Expected effect:** no stalled synthesis agents; reproducible fan-in cost.

## 2026-08-30 — Post-verification repair of drafted guards

**Trigger:** the founding verification pass (Fable verifier over the 7-builder
draft) live-demonstrated four defects and several dangling references; full
report archived in the session telemetry for 2026-08-30.

**Change:**
- `pr_merge.py`: review-verdict glob fixed to the `<sha>-*.md` files
  `review.sh` actually writes (the gate could never accept a reviewed PR);
  dead `fixes/pending` probe removed; fix-quiescence gate now probes the same
  mkdir lock `autofix.sh` holds (`locks/fix-<branch>.lock`, pid-liveness);
  cap env unified to `MIPSTARRE_FIX_CAP`.
- `autofix.sh`: releases its fix lock before the cap-time forced review
  (`review.sh` refuses to review under a live fix lock, so the terminal
  bot-fix commit was never reviewed).
- Machine-wide full-build mutex unified to `$CACHE_ROOT/.full-build-lock`
  across `cache-warmer.sh`, `warm-worktree.sh`, `ci.sh`, and the linter sweep
  (three uncoordinated locks before); `ci.sh` stale-break made
  liveness-first — a live owner is never broken by age (the initial build ran
  ~7 h against a 3 h age threshold).
- `MIPSTARRE_CACHE_DIR` → `MIPSTARRE_CACHE_ROOT` everywhere; octal-safe id
  parsing (`10#`) in `review.sh`/`autofix.sh`/`agent.sh` (ids 0008/0009
  crashed); `dispatch.sh` maps role `orc` → `orchestrator.md`; verdict files
  written atomically; template/persona citations no longer point at
  files that do not exist.

**Expected effect:** the merge gate accepts exactly the reviewed-and-green
PRs it was specified to accept; every full build contends on one mutex.

**Outcome (same day):** post-fix smoke reruns pass (see events.md).

## 2026-08-30 — Warmer seeds its first build from the primary checkout

**Trigger:** first live run of `cache-warmer.sh`: it cloned the primary repo
into `hot-main/repo` and was about to recompile ~9000 modules from source,
although the primary checkout already held a complete built `.lake` for the
same keyhash (events.md, "first warmer run").

**Change:** `cache-warmer.sh` gains `seed_hot_repo_lake`: when the hot
checkout lacks `.lake/build` and the primary checkout has one under the same
keyhash, `.lake/build` (and `.lake/packages` if absent) are cloned
copy-on-write before `lake exe cache get`/`lake build` — the local analogue
of the parent CI's restore-by-key-prefix (pr-ci.yml:144-160); the subsequent
`lake build` reduces to a trace check.

**Expected effect:** the initial warm costs minutes, not a duplicate
multi-hour compile; same mechanism covers re-seeding after a cache wipe.

## 2026-08-30 — Whitespace gate exempts byte-faithful paper mirrors

**Trigger:** the stage-2 commit of `references/qpbt-paper/` and
`references/neexp-paper/` was rejected by the pre-commit whitespace check:
the arXiv sources carry trailing whitespace and blank lines at EOF, and
normalizing them would break the mirrors' byte-identity claim (their whole
point). The LDT-era mirror never collided with the gate because it was
imported already-clean.

**Change:** `.githooks/pre-commit` runs `git diff --cached --check` with
`':(exclude)references/'`. Project prose and code keep the gate; verbatim
external sources do not.

**Expected effect:** mirrors commit unmodified; the fidelity claim in each
mirror README stays checkable forever.

## 2026-08-30 — Registry root resolves to the primary checkout

**Trigger:** running `ci.sh` from inside a PR worktree wrote the CI manifest
and `pr.md` updates to the worktree's own copy of `prs/` — a forked registry
(events.md would call this a split-brain record; caught during the stage-3
blueprint PR).

**Change:** `ci.sh`, `review.sh`, `autofix.sh`, `agent.sh` re-point their
repo root at the primary checkout via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`
(same resolution `cache-warmer.sh` and `telemetry.py` already used), so the
registry stays single-instance regardless of the invocation directory.

**Expected effect:** identical registry writes from any worktree; no forked
issue/PR records.

## 2026-08-30 — Paper-gap bibliography entries cite repository paths

**Trigger:** review round 4 of PR #0001 flagged the new `gap:` bibliography
entries for using repository paths where the parent policy expects published
site URLs.

**Change:** localized convention — with no public site, `gap:` entries'
`note` fields carry the in-repository note path (`docs/paper-gaps/…`);
`local/bin/site.sh` serves rendered notes locally. Recorded as a comment at
the entries in `blueprint/src/references.bib`.

**Expected effect:** reviewers and tooling treat repo-path citations as the
sanctioned local form; no dangling public URLs.

## 2026-08-30 — Review round cap with operator adjudication

**Trigger:** events.md, "Review loop non-convergent at the tail (PR #0001)":
five review rounds with finding counts 33, 26, 18, 12, 17 — the tail
oscillates because each round's fresh reviewer re-audits new text at
unbounded depth and cannot see prior adjudications.

**Change:** `local/protocols/review.md` gains: after **four** full review
rounds on one PR, the operator may adjudicate the remaining findings
instead of iterating — each remaining finding is either fixed, or ticked
in the current ledger with a written reason and converted to a tracked
issue; the merge may then proceed with `review_state: ADJUDICATED`
recorded in `pr.md` and the merge commit citing the adjudication. The
analogous parent mechanism is the combined bot-fix iteration cap with one
terminal review (pr-review.yml:69-72): iteration is bounded, the tail is
a human decision, and nothing is silently dropped — every unfixed finding
becomes an issue.

**Expected effect:** review loops terminate with an explicit, auditable
decision; stage-appropriate depth disputes move into the tracker instead
of blocking scaffolding merges indefinitely.

## 2026-08-31 — Merges auto-resolve registry-path conflicts with the base

**Trigger:** PR #0001's merge aborted twice on conflicts confined to
registry files (`prs/…/pr.md`, telemetry session captures) that the branch
had accumulated from earlier mis-rooted tool runs; aligning the branch's
registry to main went stale within minutes because `pr.md` mutates on main
continuously.

**Change:** `pr_merge.py` completes a conflicted merge automatically when
every conflicted path lies under `issues/`, `prs/`, or `results/telemetry/`,
resolving those paths with the base's version — correct by the
single-instance-registry protocol. Conflicts touching any other path still
abort untouched.

**Expected effect:** registry residue on branches can never block or
corrupt a merge; content conflicts remain a human decision.

## 2026-08-31 — Review lanes run in parallel

**Trigger:** stage-3 telemetry: ~30 h of PR #0001's wall time was the
review-fix loop, and each round ran the code and prose lanes sequentially
although they are independent per head SHA.

**Change:** `review.sh` dispatches the code and prose reviewer sessions
concurrently and parses sequentially. Failure semantics unchanged: a
code-lane crash blocks the PR (and reaps the still-running prose lane);
a prose-lane failure only warns. The parent ran the two as separate
parallel CI jobs (pr-review.yml), so this restores parent-level
concurrency the local port had serialized.

**Expected effect:** review wall time per round approximately halves.

## 2026-08-31 — Migration to ghz; main session handed to codex; GitHub mirror

**Trigger:** user directive: migrate the project to ghz:/home/drx/MIPStarRE-qpbt,
hand the orchestrating main-session role to a codex session there (GPT
models in place of Claude models), and mirror the repository to the private
GitHub monorepo Dengnifer/MIPStarRE-qpbt as the MIPStarRE-A/ subtree.

**Change:**
- `local/personas/main.md`: the main-session persona (operator role,
  operating loop, standing duties) — model-agnostic by construction.
- `HANDOFF.md`: state snapshot and immediate next steps at handoff.
- `local/bin/main-session.sh`: starts/resumes the interactive codex main
  session anchored at the repository root.
- `local/bin/github-sync.sh`: git-subtree mirror of main to GitHub
  (repo-scoped deploy key; full history under MIPStarRE-A/). The mirror is
  a surface only: issues, PRs, CI, reviews, and the registry remain local
  and authoritative; run the sync after each merge to main.
- macOS-only operational bits (caffeinate wake assertions) retire; the
  server does not sleep.

**Expected effect:** identical workflow semantics on the new host; the
model-family switch of the operator is a recorded telemetry datum, not a
protocol change.

## 2026-08-31 — Re-hybridization: GitHub-native issues/PRs for track A

**Trigger:** owner decision after the repository restructure (standalone
`Dengnifer/MIPStarRE-A` with its own PR space; umbrella
`MIPStarRE-qpbt` aggregates A and B as submodules). The founding
localization replaced GitHub because it was unavailable as a surface;
with it restored, the owner chose GitHub-native records.

**Change:** issues/PRs move to GitHub (seed migration:
`results/telemetry/github-migration-map.md`); CI and reviews continue to
EXECUTE locally and will post statuses/verdicts to the PR once the
tooling adaptation (HANDOFF.md step 0, owned by the incoming main
session) lands; `github-sync.sh` becomes a plain retry-hardened push;
the local registry becomes a write-through offline fallback,
authoritative in conflicts until the adaptation completes.

**Expected effect:** familiar review surfaces and separate per-track PR
management, at the cost of link-dependence for record operations — an
accepted trade recorded as a workflow-evolution datum: localization and
re-hybridization are both responses to the environment, which is the
paper's thesis in miniature.

## 2026-09-01 — GitHub becomes the workflow authority (lean port)

**Trigger:** owner decision 2026-08-31 (follow-on to the re-hybridization
entry); executed 2026-09-01 after the scope reset recorded below.

**Change:** The local issue tree and PR registry are retired.  GitHub
(`Dengnifer/MIPStarRE-A`) is the single source of truth for issues (native
sub-issues replace `parent`/`children` frontmatter), PRs, CI evidence
(per-step commit statuses `local-ci/<step>` plus `local-ci/summary` and
`local-review/summary` on the exact head SHA), review verdicts (COMMENT
reviews bound to a commit id — a single-account repo cannot self-APPROVE, so
adverseness travels in the failing `local-review/summary` status), and merges
(REST merge guarded by the exact-SHA `sha` parameter, verified by merge-commit
topology).  All GitHub traffic goes through `local/bin/gh_common.py`; shared
non-registry helpers moved to `local/bin/wf_util.py`.  `track.py`,
`validate_tree.py`, `export_issues.py`, and `local/labels.yml` are deleted —
GitHub provides what they reimplemented.  The registries were archived
verbatim first (`results/telemetry/registry-archive/`, commit c8f1999) and
stay read-only research data; `github-sync.sh` now also writes a read-only
JSON snapshot of open issues/PRs under `results/telemetry/github-snapshot/`
for offline forensics — never lifecycle input.

**Expected effect:** CI and reviews still execute locally on this machine;
GitHub stores the evidence.

## 2026-09-01 — Scope control for workflow changes (incident amendment)

**Trigger:** events.md 2026-09-01, the issue-0007 overbuild.  The first
implementation of the entry above grew, in ~17 hours and 21 commits, into a
+14.6k-line unreviewed rewrite of the whole layer — a 2,761-line bespoke
GitHub API client, a 643-line lock manager, a 5,649-line test suite wired
into the commit and push hooks (≈10 minutes per commit), an actor-verification
regime and a branch-protection evaluator nobody asked for — while the actual
product (the Lean formalization; PR #5's 17 findings) sat untouched.  The
owner paused the session, archived the branch as research data
(`telemetry/issue-0007-overbuilt`), and rebuilt the port lean.

**Change:** amendment (now also in `local/personas/main.md`):

1. The product is the Lean formalization.  `local/` is scaffolding; scaffolding
   work is a cost center, budgeted by default at ≤2 hours wall time and ≤400
   changed lines per episode.  Hitting the budget means stop, commit what
   stands, record the state, and escalate to the owner — not push through.
2. Git hooks must finish in under 60 seconds on a typical commit; heavier
   verification belongs to CI steps.
3. No new abstraction layers (API clients, lock managers, frameworks) and no
   rewrites of working, reviewed code without an explicit owner directive;
   prefer the smallest diff that satisfies the brief, and prefer `gh` + the
   REST API over reimplementation.
4. After any workflow change merges, the next dispatched work item MUST be a
   mathematics item.  Two consecutive workflow-only episodes require owner
   approval.

**Expected effect:** scaffolding episodes stay bounded and auditable, and the
work item after a merged workflow change is mathematics.
