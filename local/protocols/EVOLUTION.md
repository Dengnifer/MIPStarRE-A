# Protocol evolution ledger

Dated amendments to the protocols in this directory (and to `AGENTS.md`).
Every entry cites its trigger per `meta.md`. Newest last.

## 2026-08-30 — Founding: localization of the parent GitHub workflow

**Trigger:** project start (user directive): continue the self-evolved
workflow of LionSR/MIPStarRE with all GitHub operations replaced by local
ones; record telemetry for a research paper.

**Change:** created `local/` (DESIGN.md, protocols/, personas/, bin/),
`issues/`, `prs/`, `results/telemetry/`. `.github/` frozen as reference.
Initial protocols derived from a 7-reader study of the parent snapshot
(507e81220); the parent's post-mortem comments were ported as invariants
(single cache writer, review-after-green-CI, fix serialization + combined
iteration cap, trusted prompts, untrusted-data framing, bracket-free naming).

**Expected effect:** parity with the parent workflow's guard set from day one,
minus GitHub event plumbing, which becomes explicit script invocation.

## 2026-08-30 — Worktree bootstrap resets vendored packages

**Trigger:** events.md 2026-08-30 "Dirty vendored package blocks
`lake exe cache get`" (first build attempt failed).

**Change:** `worktree-setup.sh` resets dirty vendored package git trees
before `lake exe cache get`; the ProofWidgets fresh-state workaround from
docgen.yml:56-64 is kept alongside it.

**Expected effect:** cache fetch never aborts on inherited package dirt.

## 2026-08-30 — Fan-in data passed by path, not inline

**Trigger:** events.md 2026-08-30 "Workflow critic stalled on oversized
prompt" (study-fleet critic failure).

**Change:** orchestration rule in `sessions.md` scope: synthesis/critic
agents receive large upstream results as file paths to read, with inline
context capped; adopted for all future fan-in stages.

**Expected effect:** no stalled synthesis agents; reproducible fan-in cost.

## 2026-08-30 — Post-verification repair of drafted guards

**Trigger:** the founding verification pass (Fable verifier over the 7-builder
draft) live-demonstrated four defects and several dangling references; full
report archived in the session telemetry for 2026-08-30.

**Change:**
- `pr_merge.py`: review-verdict glob fixed to the `<sha>-*.md` files
  `review.sh` actually writes (the gate could never accept a reviewed PR);
  dead `fixes/pending` probe removed; fix-quiescence gate now probes the same
  mkdir lock `autofix.sh` holds (`locks/fix-<branch>.lock`, pid-liveness);
  cap env unified to `MIPSTARRE_FIX_CAP`.
- `autofix.sh`: releases its fix lock before the cap-time forced review
  (`review.sh` refuses to review under a live fix lock, so the terminal
  bot-fix commit was never reviewed).
- Machine-wide full-build mutex unified to `$CACHE_ROOT/.full-build-lock`
  across `cache-warmer.sh`, `warm-worktree.sh`, `ci.sh`, and the linter sweep
  (three uncoordinated locks before); `ci.sh` stale-break made
  liveness-first — a live owner is never broken by age (the initial build ran
  ~7 h against a 3 h age threshold).
- `MIPSTARRE_CACHE_DIR` → `MIPSTARRE_CACHE_ROOT` everywhere; octal-safe id
  parsing (`10#`) in `review.sh`/`autofix.sh`/`agent.sh` (ids 0008/0009
  crashed); `dispatch.sh` maps role `orc` → `orchestrator.md`; verdict files
  written atomically; template/persona citations no longer point at
  files that do not exist.

**Expected effect:** the merge gate accepts exactly the reviewed-and-green
PRs it was specified to accept; every full build contends on one mutex.

**Outcome (same day):** post-fix smoke reruns pass (see events.md).

## 2026-08-30 — Warmer seeds its first build from the primary checkout

**Trigger:** first live run of `cache-warmer.sh`: it cloned the primary repo
into `hot-main/repo` and was about to recompile ~9000 modules from source,
although the primary checkout already held a complete built `.lake` for the
same keyhash (events.md, "first warmer run").

**Change:** `cache-warmer.sh` gains `seed_hot_repo_lake`: when the hot
checkout lacks `.lake/build` and the primary checkout has one under the same
keyhash, `.lake/build` (and `.lake/packages` if absent) are cloned
copy-on-write before `lake exe cache get`/`lake build` — the local analogue
of the parent CI's restore-by-key-prefix (pr-ci.yml:144-160); the subsequent
`lake build` reduces to a trace check.

**Expected effect:** the initial warm costs minutes, not a duplicate
multi-hour compile; same mechanism covers re-seeding after a cache wipe.

## 2026-08-30 — Whitespace gate exempts byte-faithful paper mirrors

**Trigger:** the stage-2 commit of `references/qpbt-paper/` and
`references/neexp-paper/` was rejected by the pre-commit whitespace check:
the arXiv sources carry trailing whitespace and blank lines at EOF, and
normalizing them would break the mirrors' byte-identity claim (their whole
point). The LDT-era mirror never collided with the gate because it was
imported already-clean.

**Change:** `.githooks/pre-commit` runs `git diff --cached --check` with
`':(exclude)references/'`. Project prose and code keep the gate; verbatim
external sources do not.

**Expected effect:** mirrors commit unmodified; the fidelity claim in each
mirror README stays checkable forever.

## 2026-08-30 — Registry root resolves to the primary checkout

**Trigger:** running `ci.sh` from inside a PR worktree wrote the CI manifest
and `pr.md` updates to the worktree's own copy of `prs/` — a forked registry
(events.md would call this a split-brain record; caught during the stage-3
blueprint PR).

**Change:** `ci.sh`, `review.sh`, `autofix.sh`, `agent.sh` re-point their
repo root at the primary checkout via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`
(same resolution `cache-warmer.sh` and `telemetry.py` already used), so the
registry stays single-instance regardless of the invocation directory.

**Expected effect:** identical registry writes from any worktree; no forked
issue/PR records.
